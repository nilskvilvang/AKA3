  abstract = {The recent Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) requirement that hospital accreditation be based upon a Total Quality Management (TQM) approach has focused the attention of health care administrations on the use of techniques such as control charts. However, control charts are not typically adjusted for severity of illness. This adjustment is needed because, unlike industrial organizations, hospitals are not able to control all of their inputs and must accept variances in their patients. In this paper, we present a methodology for adjusting a health care organization's control charts to reflect their patient population's severity of illness during different time intervals. We then demonstrate that risk-adjusting expected patient outcomes can change our assessments of the relative quality of care offered by a health care organization in different time periods.}

To identify such a causal effect, we exploited exogenous variation in maternal education induced by schooling reforms introducing universal primary education in the second half of the 1990s in Malawi and Uganda. Using a two-stage residual inclusion approach and combining individual-level data from Demographic and Health Surveys with district-level data on the intensity of the reform, we tested whether increased maternal schooling reduced children's probability of dying before age 5. In Malawi, for each additional year of maternal education, children have a 10 \% lower probability of dying; in Uganda, the odds of dying for children of women with one additional year of education are 16.6 \% lower. We also explored which pathways might explain this effect of maternal education. The estimates suggest that financial barriers to medical care, attitudes toward modern health services, and rejection of domestic violence may play a role. Moreover, being more educated seems to confer enhanced proximity to a health facility and knowledge about the transmission of AIDS in Malawi, and wealth and improved personal illness control in Uganda.},

The choice of relatively few overall measures combined with the bottom\textendash up approach is a helpful strategy that focuses and aligns improvement work and stimulates the use of data at all levels of the organisation while leaving room for meaningful local adaptations of performance \ldots}

  abstract = {`The Problem with\ldots ' series covers controversial topics related to efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems that seem to resist solution.Many healthcare organisations now track a number of performance measures like infection and complication rates, waiting times, staff adherence to guidelines, etc. Our own organisation, The Capital Region of Denmark, provides healthcare for 1.7 million people and runs 6 hospitals and 11 mental health centres. Measures of clinical quality have been widely used in our region locally at hospitals and departments for many years. Recently, our region started to systematically define and track strategical key performance measures also at the top management level. Approximately 25 measures on a wide range of subjects from hospital infections to public transportation are being tracked by the top management and the Regional Council.The measurement strategy for hospitals involves a bottom\textendash up approach allowing each hospital and department to, if needed, define its own performance measures that feed into one or more of the overall measures. For example, bacteraemia is one of the overall measures, and some acute-care departments, who rarely see hospital-acquired bacteraemia, have started to work on reducing the use of bladder catheters in order to reduce the risk of bacteraemia from catheter-related urinary tract infections diagnosed after their patients have been transferred to other departments.

By doing so, it offers the first shift from the individual reflective practitioner to processes of collective and public reflection. The unique and varied contributions focus on the development of notions such as public reflection, collective reflection, and critical reflection. In doing so, they provide critical insights into new thinking and approaches to the role of reflection in organizations, as well as the conceptualization and delivery of learning and change. Organizing Reflection will be of interest to scholars working in business, professional, management and organization studies, to human development academics, and to scholarly practitioners in organizations.},

Statistical process control (SPC) is an important and powerful technique for the continuous improvement of product and process quality. The control chart is the familiar tool used within SPC for determining out-of-control situations and thereby eliminating or reducing variation in processes. However, a control chart is by no means the only ingredient \textendash{} nor necessarily the most important \textendash{} for the successful application of SPC. This paper identifies and discusses these key ingredients for the successful application of SPC in both manufacturing and service organisations.}

The basic philosophical and theoretical foundations of statistical quality control and their relation to epidemiology are emphasized in order to expand mutual understanding and cross-fertilization between these two disciplines. Part I provides an overview of quality engineering and SPC, illustrates common types of control charts, and provides references for further information or statistical formulae. Part II discusses statistical properties of control charts, issues of chart design and optimal control limit widths, alternate possible SPC approaches to infection control, some common misunderstandings, and more advanced issues. The focus of both articles is mostly non-mathematical, emphasizing important concepts and practical examples rather than academic theory and exhaustive calculations}

  abstract = {Improvement of health care requires making changes in processes of care and service delivery. Although process performance is measured to determine if these changes are having the desired beneficial effects, this analysis is complicated by the existence of natural variation-that is, repeated measurements naturally yield different values and, even if nothing was done, a subsequent measurement might seem to indicate a better or worse performance. Traditional statistical analysis methods account for natural variation but require aggregation of measurements over time, which can delay decision making. Statistical process control (SPC) is a branch of statistics that combines rigorous time series analysis methods with graphical presentation of data, often yielding insights into the data more quickly and in a way more understandable to lay decision makers. SPC and its primary tool-the control chart-provide researchers and practitioners with a method of better understanding and communicating data from healthcare improvement efforts. This paper provides an overview of SPC and several practical examples of the healthcare applications of control charts.},

  abstract = {A recent article by Jamieson in Medical Education outlined some of the (alleged) abuses of ``Likert scales'' with suggestions about how researchers can overcome some of the (alleged) methodological pitfalls and limitations[1]. However, many of the ideas advanced in the Jamison article, as well as a great many of articles it cited, and similar recent articles in medical, health, psychology, and educational journals and books, are themselves common misunderstandings, misconceptions, conceptual errors, persistent myths and ``urban legends'' about ``Likert scales'' and their characteristics and qualities that have been propagated and perpetuated across six decades, for a variety of different reasons. This article identifies, analyses and traces many of these aforementioned problems and presents the arguments, counter arguments and empirical evidence that show these many persistent claims and myths about ``Likert scales'' to be factually incorrect and untrue. Many studies have shown that Likert Scales (as opposed to single Likert response format items) produce interval data and that the F-test is very robust to violations of the interval data assumption and moderate skewing and may be used to analyze ``Likert data'' (even if it is ordinal), but not on an item-by-item ``shotgun'' basis, which is simply a current research and analysis practice that must stop. After sixty years, it is more than time to dispel these particular research myths and urban legends as well as the various damage and problems they cause, and put them to bed and out of their misery once and for all.},

  abstract = {Significance             We propose genetic instrumental variable (GIV) regression\textemdash a method that controls for pleiotropic effects of genes on two variables. GIV regression is broadly applicable to study outcomes for which polygenic scores from large-scale genome-wide association studies are available. We explore the performance of GIV regression in the presence of pleiotropy across a range of scenarios and find that it yields more accurate estimates than alternative approaches such as ordinary least-squares regression or Mendelian randomization. When GIV regression is combined with proper controls for purely environmental sources of bias (e.g., using control variables and sibling fixed effects), it improves our understanding of the causal relationships between genetically correlated variables.           ,              Identifying causal effects in nonexperimental data is an enduring challenge. One proposed solution that recently gained popularity is the idea to use genes as instrumental variables [i.e., Mendelian randomization (MR)]. However, this approach is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated, which implies the possibility that many genes could affect both the exposure and the outcome directly or via unobserved confounding factors. Thus, pleiotropic effects of genes are themselves a source of bias in nonexperimental data that would also undermine the ability of MR to correct for endogeneity bias from nongenetic sources. Here, we propose an alternative approach, genetic instrumental variable (GIV) regression, that provides estimates for the effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of pleiotropy. As a valuable byproduct, GIV regression also provides accurate estimates of the chip heritability of the outcome variable. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGSs) for the outcome of interest which can be constructed from genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. By splitting the GWAS sample for the outcome into nonoverlapping subsamples, we obtain multiple indicators of the outcome PGSs that can be used as instruments for each other and, in combination with other methods such as sibling fixed effects, can address endogeneity bias from both pleiotropy and the environment. In two empirical applications, we demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable estimates of the chip heritability of educational attainment (EA) and show that standard regression and MR provide upwardly biased estimates of the effect of body height on EA.},

The purpose of this report is to illustrate how the quality of the anesthesia process can be analyzed using statistical process control methods, and exemplify how this analysis can be used for quality improvement. METHODS We prospectively recorded anesthesia-related data from all anesthetics for five years. The data included intraoperative adverse events, which were graded into four levels, according to severity. We selected four adverse events, representing important quality and safety aspects, for statistical process control analysis. These were: inadequate regional anesthesia, difficult emergence from general anesthesia, intubation difficulties and drug errors. We analyzed the underlying process using 'p-charts' for statistical process control. RESULTS In 65,170 anesthetics we recorded adverse events in 18.3\%; mostly of lesser severity. Control charts were used to define statistically the predictable normal variation in problem rate, and then used as a basis for analysis of the selected problems with the following results: Inadequate plexus anesthesia: stable process, but unacceptably high failure rate; Difficult emergence: unstable process, because of quality improvement efforts; Intubation difficulties: stable process, rate acceptable; Medication errors: methodology not suited because of low rate of errors. CONCLUSION By applying statistical process control methods to the analysis of adverse events, we have exemplified how this allows us to determine if a process is stable, whether an intervention is required, and if quality improvement efforts have the desired effect.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is widely used by researchers in the social sciences to characterize the latent structure underlying a set of observed indicator variables. One of the primary issues that must be resolved when conducting an EFA is determination of the number of factors to retain. There exist a large number of statistical tools designed to address this question, with none being universally optimal across applications. Recently, researchers have investigated the use of model fit indices that are commonly used in the conduct of confirmatory factor analysis to determine the number of factors to retain in EFA. These results have yielded mixed results, appearing to be effective when used in conjunction with normally distributed indicators, but not being as effective for categorical indicators. The purpose of this simulation study was to compare the performance of difference values for several fit indices as a method for identifying the optimal number of factors to retain in an EFA, with parallel analysis, which is one of the most reliable such extant methods. Results of the simulation demonstrated that the use of fit index difference values outperformed parallel analysis for categorical indicators, and for normally distributed indicators when factor loadings were small. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Numerous rules-of-thumb have been suggested for determining the minimum number of subjects required to conduct multiple regression analyses. These rules-of-thumb are evaluated by comparing their results against those based on power analyses for tests of hypotheses of multiple and partial correlations. The results did not support the use of rules-of-thumb that simply specify some constant (e.g., 100 subjects) as the minimum number of subjects or a minimum ratio of number of subjects (N) to number of predictors (m). Some support was obtained for a rule-of-thumb that N {$\geq$} 50 + 8 m for the multiple correlation and N {$\geq$}104 + m for the partial correlation. However, the rule-of-thumb for the multiple correlation yields values too large for N when m {$\geq$} 7, and both rules-of-thumb assume all studies have a medium-size relationship between criterion and predictors. Accordingly, a slightly more complex rule-of thumb is introduced that estimates minimum sample size as function of effect size as well as the number of predictors. It is argued that researchers should use methods to determine sample size that incorporate effect size.}

This paper outlines the major theories of measurement and their relationships and describes the different kinds of models and hypotheses which may be formulated within each theory. One general conclusion is that the domains of applicability of the two major theories are typically different, and it is this which helps apparent contradictions to be avoided in most practical applications.}

The resulting time-ordered charts are capable of reducing time-to-time variation that may stem from uncontrollable changes in patient mix over time. Depending on how observed and risk-adjusted data are combined, proposed charts are categorized under the framework of either additive or multiplicative models. Risk-adjusted rates are obtained using multivariate logistic regression models. It was found that the risk-adjusted control charts could be effective in reducing biases that arise from variation in patient mix. These charts can potentially achieve higher sensitivity and specificity compared with ordinary control charts.},

The key feature of these charts is their application of risk-adjusted data in addition to actual performance data. The resulting charts should decrease the occurrence of both type I and type II errors as compared to the unadjusted control charts. This article presents several control charts that vary in the data transformation and combination approaches. Data depicting hospital length of stay following coronary artery bypass graft procedures were used to illustrate the use of transformed and risk-adjusted control charts.},

First, this study expounds the chronological development of statistical quality control (SQC) to date, for there is a paucity of an up-to-date chronology of SQC in the literature. Second, the concept of statistical quality control has been analysed from the perspective of scientific inquiry to determine whether SQC has evolved or has been evolving as an evolutionary, revolutionary or progressive research program. Third, this paper discusses whether the discipline of statistical quality control has its own research tradition. We employed a qualitative method to address our research questions. We argue that the concept of statistical quality control has emerged as a scientific revolution in the arena of quality control and that the discipline of statistical quality control has its own research tradition. This study provides both practitioners and academicians with not only an up-to-date account of SQC but a sense of the legitimacy of SQC as a discipline. SQC provides a system's perspective to quality control and has paved the way for enterprise-wide quality philosophies such as TQC, TQM, zero defects, Six Sigma, ISO, etc.}

The allure of CFA over other approaches to the study of hypothetical constructs is the capacity for testing detailed hypotheses in a deductive mode. Moreover, CFA models can be incorporated directly into general structural equation modeling (SEM) that includes directional relations among hypothetical constructs. It is noted that the central concern of CFA is modeling factors, sometimes referred to as latent variables. Factors are influences that are not directly measured, but account for commonality among a set of measurements. Recent developments in technical aspects of estimation and testing coupled with widely accessible and user-friendly software have rendered CFA more popular and appealing than ever. However, with the increased accessibility of CFA comes a responsibility to understand the conditions under which CFA is appropriately applied and the factors relevant to interpretation of CFA results.},

  abstract = {AIMS To illustrate the construction of statistical control charts and show their potential application to analysis of outcomes in children's surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two datasets recording outcomes following esophageal atresia repair and intestinal resection for Crohn's disease maintained by the author were used to construct four types of charts. The effects of altering the target signal, the alarm signal and the limits are illustrated. The dilemmas in choice of target rate are described. Simulated data illustrate the advantages over hypothesis testing. RESULTS The charts show the author's institutional leak rate for esophageal atresia repair may be within acceptable limits, but that this is dependent on the target set. The desirable target is contentious. The leak rate for anastomoses following intestinal resection for Crohn's disease leak is also within acceptable limits when compared to published experience, but may be deteriorating. The charts are able to detect deteriorating levels of performance well before hypothesis testing would suggest a systematic problem with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Statistical process control charts can provide surgeons with early warning of systematic poor performance. They are robust to volume-outcome influences, since the outcome is tested sequentially after each procedure or patient. They have application in a specialty with low frequencies of operations such as children's surgery. TYPE OF STUDY Diagnostic test. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II.},

  abstract = {Objective Measurements from health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) studies, although usually of an ordered categorical nature, are typically treated as continuous variables, allowing the calculation of mean values and the administration of parametric statistics, such as t-tests. We investigated whether parametric, compared to nonparametric, analyses of ordered categorical data may lead to different conclusions. Study Design and Setting HRQoL data were obtained from patients with a diagnosis of asthma (n = 192) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 88) at two time points. The impact of the group factor (asthma vs. COPD) and the time factor (t1 vs. t2) on HRQoL was analyzed with a metric approach (repeated measures ANOVA) and two ordinal approaches (each with a nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA). Results Using the metric approach, a significant effect of ``group'' (P = 0.0061) and ``time'' (P = 0.0049) on HRQoL was found. The first ordinal approach (ranked total score) still showed a significant effect for ``group'' (P = 0.0033) with a worse HRQoL for patients suffering from COPD. In the second approach (ranks for each HRQoL item and summed ranks), there were no significant effects. Conclusion Applying simple parametric methods to ordered categorical HRQoL scores led to different results from those obtained with nonparametric methods. In these cases, an ordinal approach will prevent inappropriate conclusions.},

These arguments are concerned with (1) the insensitivity of ordinal and other nonparametric techniques, (2) the small error that results from assigning numbers to ordinal data and then treating the categories as if they conform to an interval scale, (3) tests of statistical robustness, and (4) the power-efficiency of tests. The utility of assigning numbers or scoring systems to ordinal data and then using intervally-based statistics is supported in several ways. In addition, it is demonstrated that the linear scoring system results in a small amount of error no matter what the "true" scoring system may be. However, the assignment of any scoring system must be consistent with the monotonic function.}

Monitoring and recognition of CCPs is also an importance process in manufacturing. This implies that ability to classify CCPs with high accuracy is essential. This study attempts to implement CCPs classifiers which are capable of dealing with CCPs with different level of noise. Extracting image processing statistical features is adopted as preprocessing technique. The work also investigates the effect of level of noise in classification. Three different types of techniques for implementing classifiers are selected, these are Decision Tree, Neural network and an evolutionary based program, known as Self-adjusting Association Rules Generator (SARG). It was found that SARG yielded the best performance among them. To date, this study is an attempt to classify particular model of CCPs with highest level of noise.},

  abstract = {Los Angeles (US:  (listen) lawss AN-j{$\Elzschwa$}l-{$\Elzschwa$}s; Spanish: Los \'Angeles [los {$\Elzverts$}a\ng xeles], lit.\,'The Angels'), often referred to by its initials L.A., is the largest city in California. With a 2020 population of 3,898,747  it is the second-largest city in the United States following New York City. Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic and cultural diversity, Hollywood film industry, and sprawling metropolitan area. The city of Los Angeles lies in a basin in Southern California. Adjacent to the Pacific Ocean extending through the Santa Monica Mountains and into the San Fernando Valley it covers about 469 square miles (1,210 km2). It is the seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with just over 10 million residents in 2020. Home to the Chumash and Tongva indigenous peoples, the area that became Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodr\'iguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican\textendash American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and thus became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California. Los Angeles has a diverse and robust economy, and hosts businesses in a broad range of professional and cultural fields. It also has the busiest container port in the Americas. In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over \$1.0 trillion, making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after Tokyo and New York City. Los Angeles hosted the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics and will host the 2028 Summer Olympics.},

The kind of questionnaire material falls into four classes: yes-no, multiple choice, propositions to be responded to by degrees of approval, and a series of brief newspaper narratives to be approved or disapproved in various degrees. The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale. A bibliography is also given.

The combined results demonstrate positive, continuous, and apparently independent associations, with no significant heterogeneity of effect among different studies. Within the range of DBP studied (about 70-110 mm Hg), there was no evidence of any "threshold" below which lower levels of DBP were not associated with lower risks of stroke and of CHD. Previous analyses have described the uncorrected associations of DBP measured just at "baseline" with subsequent disease rates. But, because of the diluting effects of random fluctuations in DBP, these substantially underestimate the true associations of the usual DBP (ie, an individual's long-term average DBP) with disease. After correction for this "regression dilution" bias, prolonged differences in usual DBP of 5,7{$\cdot$}5, and 10 mm Hg were respectively associated with at least 34\%, 46\%, and 56\% less stroke and at least 21\%. 29\%, and 37\% less CHD. These associations are about 60\% greater than in previous uncorrected analyses. (This regression dilution bias is quite general, so analogous corrections to the relations of cholesterol to CHD or of various other risk factors to C H D or to other diseases would likewise increase their estimated strengths.) The DBP results suggest that for the large majority of individuals, whether conventionally "hypertensive" or "normotensive", a lower blood pressure should eventually confer a lower risk of vascular disease.}

Under purely common cause variation the control limits on the xmr-chart and traditional attribute charts (eg, p-chart, c-chart, u-chart) will be in close agreement, indicating that the observed variation (xmr-chart) is consistent with the underlying Binomial model (p-chart) or Poisson model (c-chart, u-chart). However, when there is a material difference between the limits from the xmr-chart and the attribute chart then this also constitutes a signal of an underlying systematic special cause of variation. We use one simulation and two case studies to demonstrate these ideas and show the utility of plotting the SPC chart for attribute data alongside an xmr-chart. We conclude that the combined use of attribute charts and xmr-charts, which requires little additional effort, is a useful strategy because it is less likely to mislead us and more likely to give us the insight to do the right thing.}

Although SPC is part of an overall philosophy of continual improvement, the implementation of SPC usually requires the production of control charts. However, as SPC is relatively new to healthcare practitioners and is not routinely featured in medical statistics texts/courses, there is a need to explain the issues involved in the selection and construction of control charts in practice. Following a brief overview of SPC in healthcare and preliminary issues, we use a tutorial-based approach to illustrate the selection and construction of four commonly used control charts (xmr-chart, p-chart, u-chart, c-chart) using examples from healthcare. For each control chart, the raw data, the relevant formulae and their use and interpretation of the final SPC chart are provided together with a notes section highlighting important issues for the SPC practitioner. Some more advanced topics are also mentioned with suggestions for further reading.},

  abstract = {Have you ever heard the criticism that a quality improvement project was not scientific because it was not carried out as a randomised controlled trial (RCT)? These critics have got it wrong and here is why. This answer requires a review of the scientific method. (There are lots of good references to the scientific method. See http://www.wikipedia.org on ``the scientific method''.) At its core, science is based on generalisable theory. This theory leads to hypotheses which can be tested experimentally over and over again. If the test fails, the theory must be rejected or modified. Replication, not peer review, is the standard of scientific evidence. Look at the pen in your hand. There is scientific theory called gravity from which you can hypothesise that if you let go of your pen it will fall to your desk top. Drop your pen and you have tested this hypothesis and supported the theory of gravity. If instead, your pen flies into the air you may have thrown it, be on a space ship or in Harry Potter's magic arts class. The first two possibilities are well defined and predictable by the full mathematical theory of gravity. The third possibility puts us in the realm of imagination which we can enjoy, but not replicate in reality. In a way, Harry Potter's Hogwarts School is like pure mathematics. Both are built on assumptions that lead logically to imaginary behaviour or theory which are beyond our real world of experimentation. Scientific theory simplifies reality, tells us what is important, and allows us to generalise to other circumstances. It does not matter for the simple theory of gravity whether your pen is blue or black or even if it is a pencil or a penny. Theory defines what is not relevant, and what is relevant (height \ldots}

While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for "getting the wrong answer".},

Unfortunately, this variation can cloud our decision making and lead us to take inappropriate action. The control chart is a basic quality management tool that helps managers and clinicians make statistically sound decisions when analyzing outcome data from processes. In this tutorial, we will illustrate the problems inherent in taking action based on data that displays variation. We will then develop the statistical foundation for control charts and show an example of its use to analyze data from a pharmacy process.},

  abstract = {This article considers statistical process control (SPC) of univariate processes when the parametric form of the process distribution is unavailable. Most existing SPC procedures are based on the assumption that a parametric form (e.g., normal) of the process distribution can be specified beforehand. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that their performance is unreliable in cases when the prespecified process distribution is invalid. To overcome this limitation, some nonparametric (or distribution-free) SPC charts have been proposed, most of which are based on the ordering information of the observed data. This article tries to make two contributions to the nonparametric SPC literature. First, we propose an alternative framework for constructing nonparametric control charts, by first categorizing observed data and then applying categorical data analysis methods to SPC. Under this framework, some new nonparametric control charts are proposed. Second, we compare our proposed control charts with several representative existing control charts in various cases. Some empirical guidelines are provided for users to choose a proper nonparametric control chart for a specific application. This article has supplementary materials online.}

We answer this question using attitudinal and behavioral specifications of risk aversion drawn from the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). To approximate attitudinal specification of risk aversion, we use individuals' self-reported financial risk tolerance. We use individuals' relative risk aversion, that is, the effect of wealth on the proportion of assets categorized as risky as behavioral specification of risk aversion. We find that while women display greater attitudinal risk aversion, gender difference in behavioral risk aversion depends upon individuals' marital status and role in household finances. Single women exhibit greater behavioral risk aversion compared to single men. However, this gender difference does not exist when we compare behavioral risk aversion of married women and men in charge of household finances.},

This is the only way one can successfully measure thoughts, emotions and other criteria that are not always openly displayed.

They include case studies of four aspects of hidden or elusive everyday social actions: lying, telling secrets, withholding compliments and feeling envy.},

  abstract = {Current widespread implementation and practice of statistical process control (SPC) attest to the potential of SPC to contribute to continuous quality improvement efforts. While much has been written about SPC- related topics, a more fundamental question \textemdash{} ``What does the implementation and practice of SPC entail?'' \textemdash{} has yet to merit a detailed conceptual or empirical examination. As a result, very little knowledge has accumulated or has been documented to identify, describe, and define the requisite organizational policies and actions to make the implementation and subsequent practice of SPC an effective and viable part of any organization's quality management system. In this paper, we report on research efforts towards an enhanced conceptualization of this phenomenon; we provide various definitional perspectives on organizational efforts to implement and practice SPC, culminating in the proposition of the construct, SPC Implementation/ Practice, and its nominal definition. We also employ an empirical approach, utilizing a panel of subject-matter-experts and the affinity diagram, to identify and define a set of 14 requisite policies and actions indicative of the implementation and practice of SPC within organizations. The identification of these 14 requisite policies and actions facilitates the construction of a diagnostic instrument that organizations can employ to assess shortcomings and uncover improvement opportunities in their implementation and practice of SPC.}

Employs a standard procedure to create a measurement instrument comprising 14 measurement scales, with the number of constituent measurement items ranging from one to four, that correspond to the 14 dimensions underlying the SPC implementation/practice construct. Reports the results of assessing three properties of measurement quality for these newly-created measurement scales, namely: face validity, internal consistency reliability and uni-dimensionality. Such a measurement instrument can then be applied to examine antecedents and consequences of SPC implementation/practice and to diagnose existing organizational efforts at implementing and practicing SPC and to identify opportunities to improve organizational implementation and practice of this quality improvement intervention. Demonstrates the application and interpretation of the SPC implementation/practice measurement instrument within one organizational setting. Concludes by identifying future research needs.}

  abstract = {The deployment of statistical process control (SPC) in manufacturing environments is a prominent global phenomenon. Managers have frequently justified investments in SPC by citing and/or demonstrating the improvements in quality and costs from the effective implementation and practice of SPC. This paper complements this rationalization by presenting conceptual arguments and empirical evidence to further our understanding of the motivational effects that result from the deployment of SPC within production environments. Several hypotheses derived from relating the deployment of SPC to process operators' jobs and their affective reactions to work are tested using data provided by 100 process operators. The empirical results, generated from applying path analysis, suggest that the effective implementation and practice of SPC, in fact, would create more enriched jobs for process operators that lead to higher levels of work motivation and job satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Control charts, the most popular tool of statistical process control, appeared in the literature to ensure that an industrial process is operating only with natural variability, i.e., under statistical control. In the last decades, control charts have been also widely used to assess the quality of non-industrial processes, such as medicine and public health. Mainly in the last two decades, a modification of standard and advanced control charts appeared in the bibliography to improve the monitoring mainly of medical processes. This is the risk-adjusted control charts which take into consideration the varying health conditions of the patients. These charts are used to monitor certain medical processes such as surgeries, mortality, and doctors' experience. In this paper, we have tried to present all the risk-adjusted control charts presented in the literature appropriately categorized. The risk-adjusted charts have been grouped into three categories: control charts for continuous variables, control charts for attributes (non-continuous variables), time-weighted control charts. The application of risk-adjusted control charts in practical medical processes is also discussed. This review paper highlights the value of the risk-adjusted control charts.}

The standard pronunciation models - Received Pronunciation and General American - have recently been confronted with a new proposal of a Lingua Franca Core (LFC) or English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), put forward as a didactic priority in teaching English pronunciation to foreigners. This volume, which includes selected contributions from the Pozna\'n Linguistic Meetings of 2003 and 2004, does not intend to present yet another model, but sets out to place the teaching and learning of English pronunciation in the context of the 21st century. As the needs of English users are clearly changing fast in the globalizing world, the question is to what extent, if at all, models of pronunciation have been able to keep up with them, and whether they in fact should do so. Thus, key issues in the integration of pronunciation into English as L2 curricula are explored.},

DATA SOURCES: Original articles found in relevant databases, including Web of Science and Medline, covering the period 1966 to June 2004. STUDY SELECTION: From 311 articles, 57 empirical studies, published between 1990 and 2004, met the inclusion criteria. METHODS: A standardised data abstraction form was used for extracting data relevant to the review questions, and the data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Statistical process control was applied in a wide range of settings and specialties, at diverse levels of organisation and directly by patients, using 97 different variables. The review revealed 12 categories of benefits, 6 categories of limitations, 10 categories of barriers, and 23 factors that facilitate its application and all are fully referenced in this report. Statistical process control helped different actors manage change and improve healthcare processes. It also enabled patients with, for example asthma or diabetes mellitus, to manage their own health, and thus has therapeutic qualities. Its power hinges on correct and smart application, which is not necessarily a trivial task. This review catalogs 11 approaches to such smart application, including risk adjustment and data stratification. CONCLUSION: Statistical process control is a versatile tool which can help diverse stakeholders to manage change in healthcare and improve patients' health.}

It also enabled patients with, for example asthma or diabetes mellitus, to manage their own health, and thus has therapeutic qualities. Its power hinges on correct and smart application, which is not necessarily a trivial task. This review catalogs 11 approaches to such smart application, including risk adjustment and data stratification. CONCLUSION Statistical process control is a versatile tool which can help diverse stakeholders to manage change in healthcare and improve patients' health.},

However, researchers must make several thoughtful and evidence-based methodological decisions while conducting an EFA, and there are a number of options available at each decision point, some better than others. Reviews of the professional literature have consistently found that many applications of EFA are marked by an injudicious choice of methods and incomplete reports. This article provides a systematic, evidence-based guide to the conduct of EFA studies that can be followed by researchers with modest statistical training, supplemented with an example to illustrate its application.},

  abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},
